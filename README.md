They are my firs machine learning scripts, after reading some books, and scikit-learn tutorial

I'm trying to explain my path of thinking, so it's a lot of comments
Also I haven't amended script, after I saw a mistake, so it is some bad decisions, and miss conceptions in it

The repo contain:

1 urea_stone:
Classification, with knn, and svc models
result is rater mediocre, but perhaps it is issue of data

2 diabetes:
Classification with Naive Bayes, and decision tree
Result is excellent with 100% accuracy in train, and test data, but one time more data issue
Also some feature selection mistakes have been made
